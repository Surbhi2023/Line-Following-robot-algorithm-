# Line-Following-robot-algorithm-
This repository contains the code for a line-following robot equipped with three infrared (IR) sensors for precise navigation. The code implements logic for the robot to follow a predefined path by interpreting sensor data and controlling motor movements accordingly. Optimize and customize the behavior of your line-following robot with this code.
